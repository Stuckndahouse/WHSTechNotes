My thoughts on the new cell phone law is that it is pointless and won't have the effect lawmakers think it will. I'm adjusting to the law but it's annoying for me and other students. Truthfully I see little to no benefits for students or teachers alike. My first point is that the phone law is pointless, kids who dont want to learn will still choose not to participate, but instead of risking their phones they will likely just distract other students or teachers solely for their own enjoyment. I've seen this in my 2nd period, kids will just talk to other students, make noise, and still not do their work. My complaint about the law being an inconvenience rather than a decent and well planned law is from the beginning of the year. Teachers still had several activities and systems that relied on phones,especially before chromebooks were issued to students, and had to find ways to still include those activities or just skip them entirely. It also takes away time from teachers and admins having to police the halls for students with earbuds, headphones, or cell phones out, even though they're not in class yet. And lastly, I see no benefit for teachers or students. Teachers have almost always had an issue with a student's phone being out while the teacher is speaking, but now they HAVE to enforce the phone law. If a student is done with all their work, they can't have their phones out, even if a teacher is done teaching, if the teacher sees a phone, they are now required to stop what they're doing and either tell the sudent to put it away or take it from them entirely. Not to mention the law was signed in by a man that hasn't seen the inside of a school in about 50 years and has no clue what happens inside a modern school building. The law was signed in to appease a minority with money rather than a majority in mind and it's ridiculous.

One career i'm interested in is game design/developement. Computer science would be very useful in this field of work, and would allow me to be even better at it. Computer science is useful in this career because games are made almost exclusively with computers or similar technology. Coding computers would provide a pathway into coding games, and helping create them. Learning computer science before I even start would also provide a boost to my skills and necessary experience to be considered for a job in that field. Jobs in game developement earn on average 100,000$ in the U.S. Texas is a bit lower but not by much.

My idea for an AI project would be to have AI pick up brainwaves from disabled patients, relay the information to a computer and the brainwaves be translated into speach in real time. Think of the setup being somewhat like the neuralink, but instead of it being connected to your phone or car, it would be connected to a small machine with a speaker in it that would allow paralyzed, crippled or mute people to speak again. This could also easily turn into a device that allows prosthetic limbs to move on their own. Limbs like this already exist and react to muscle spasms in the body or arm, adding the ability to translate brainwave into action would just further improve the device.depending on the user the speaker could be implanted or it can be an external device as well.

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a bad idea and will harm the future of jobs. Working in a virtual store sets a bad precedent for how the future of jobs look, not only because they can be replaced easily through the use of ai but also how unsustainable it is. Stocking fake shelves, serving fake food and other actions that do not impact the real world don't matter, especially not enough to get paid for it. Working online should be reserved for technologically dependent jobs, or jobs that require working with computers like logistics, it should not and cannot be the new standard for jobs.

The joke, "67" came from an interview with LaMelo Ball. LaMelo used the numbers as a way to joke about someone's height. The joke gained popularity for being used in Skrilla's song, "Doot Doot". Skrilla's song appeared in edits featuring LaMelo Ball. The phrase became popular, and people began saying it as a joke when "67" appeared. The Joke is typically said in a light hearted manner.

If I were in charge of the school, my AI policy would be that using AI is banned in the use of schoolwork, whether that be teachers creating work, or it or students answering with AI. My Tech policy would be that phones are allowed to be used in the hallways and lunch, or when a teacher allows the student to use it. My policy with chromebooks would be to only ban innapropriate sites, or sites that can used to purchase things or watch shows. My reason to allow game sites is that students will just find more game sites some of which not being safe, and I would rather student use safe, trusted sites rather than sits that may contain malware. I also believe policies regarding a student's personal technology should be up to teachers or the school, not a state or federal government decision.

The prompt was designed create a graphic used to explain the water cycle in a comprehensive way to highschool level students. Canva interpereted it fine, although almost all the words were fake or not words at all. I then asked Canva to animate the graphic and Canva didn't do it. So I asked Canva to create interactive elements and the AI still didn't work. I could not figure out a way to get the AI to create interactive elements or animate the graphic because when i asked the ai to do so, it didn't work. I could improve my prompt next time by improving my knowledge of Canva's ai and how to use it and its functions better.

Technology can be used to access and spread awareness of alternative food programs. SNAP running out of funding is a big deal because it effects those who don't have enough money or resources to feed themselves, and if they cant feed themselves then there is a possibility that they may die. Technology could help those people by showing them alternative programs or institutes that provide food or medicine. The problem with tech-based solutions however, is that those who cannot afford food, likely cant afford the technology or internet for such technology, needed to see those programs. If I were creating a tool to help food insecurity, it would be called AIFPA, or the Artificial Intelligence Food Program Assesor. This program would be a free site that anyone can visit and it would use the persons location or city to find nearby food programs, drives or institutions like churches or food banks that people can visit.

Technology has greatly changed the way the holidays are celebrated for many people, and in my opinion the change was for the better. Some people are unable to visit family or return home for the holidays for various reasons, whether that be health, finances or weather; but technology allows them to still see their family. Though there is a negative effect to this technology as well, people may not visit or go out simply because of laziness which leads to less of that holiday feeling and more of a zoom call. Although technology has its negative effects, I believe that the positives far outway the negatives. I also believe that the ddevelopers for holiday tech (toys and AIs) should be responsible for making sure that the familys they belong to recieve the most possible privacy they can with said product. This is because no company or algorithm should be preying on the people that use them, whether that be entertainment or neccessity.

I am very excited for Thanksgiving break. My family and I will be running in the turkey trot on Thanksgiving day. I'm also excited that family might be able to come down and visit. I am also excited for the break from schoolwork.

One job that uses drones is an agricultural drone pilot. These pilots use drones to survey crops and animals,and map/plan fields. The pilots will code parameters for the drone's mission like flight path, altitude, and speed to make the process autonomous. The average salary in Texas for these pilots is $105,000 a year. To work this job you would need a Part 107 license, a TACAL for spraying chemicals, and ppassing the state-level pesticide applicator exam. Personally, I wooulldn't want to work this job in the future just because it doesn't really seem all that fun; but it does look interesting.

A self driving car may fail too recognize or respond to a stopped school bus because of either the AI not being trained properly to respond and react, or the AI may rely too heavily on GPS and official signage rather than the world around it. The car's cameras or sensors may be looking in the wrong spots or for the the wrong things enirely. This could be because the AI wasn't trained properly by its creators or just a bug in the system. If I were on the Waymo team, one fix I would make to fix this problem would likey be to train the AI better on how to recognize and respond to schoolbusses when driving and when stopped. I woul also make the AI rely less heavily on GPS and more on the signs and world around it, stopping when it detects ANY stop sign on the road, changes like that.

My plans for this Winter break are to go on a 5 day cruise to Mexico. After the cruise we are going to celebrate Christmas and maybe have family come visit. I'm super excited for the cruise coming up soon.

Over the break I used technology by staying in touch with people over the phone. I also just got a brand new computer so I was able to use that to play games and speak to other people while playing. When I went on my cruise, I used my phone's camera to take pictures and videos of the ship and the water. Then when I went to a wrestling meet, I had to use my phone to keep up with the schedule of who was up next and when.

Autcraft was created to solve the problem of autistic children experiencing bulling and harassment online. Safe spaces are necessary on the internet because without them; bullying, harassment, threats, and even predators will flood many online spaces and discourage users from even going online to begin with. Developers have a responsibility to design and protect these safe spaces because if a developer allows negativity (bullying,harassment,etc.), then users of that developer's platform or game may be harmed or even harm themselves. If developers ignore making the proper tools for users to report and block other users for innapropriate or hateful behavior then the platform's experience drops as well, as the platform will likely be used by hateful users to spread toxicity or hateful speech. Although I know there are many safe online spaces, I don't really know them by name, and one's that used to be safe are not as safe now as they were then.

Technology and its uses can create a more fair and just sociecty by allowing those without the physical capability to stand up for themselves. There's plenty wrong with the world and say that a person wants to go out and prostest or even fight for what they believe is right, but that person lacks the physical capability to do so; disablities like blindness, missing or crippled limbs, hearing or even vocal issue that literally prevent the person from speaking up for themselves. There are many issues that can cause someone to be unable to speak up for themselves, especially when it matters most. With technology, problems like this suddenly dont matter when it's time for the person to speak out, even people who are not disabled. Technology allows everyone, impaired or not, to have a voice in their community and their government. Everyone can have a voice for themselves, their own opinions and ideas, and this brings about new ways to solve and think about problems, and allows everyone to be seen and heard.

This week I took the reading and writing map tests. I feel like both tests went fairly well and I did alright, the writing test was a bit more difficult than the reading test but I still feel as though I did alright. I think that test prepp probably would have helped me do better but I think that I did okay without it.

Hygiene and self care is important, especially in a public setting. Having good hygiene and self care is an important part of staying healthy and being in a shared space; it improves one's ability to focus and allows others around you to focus as well. One of the most important parts of being in a public space is respecting those around you, you can do this by keeping a low volume when talking, not engaging in distracting behavior and even something as simple as not eating or drinking near them. Another important part respecting a public space and the people in it is practicing self control, talking quieter, not being rude to others, controlling emotions and watching language are good habits when practicing self control. One habit that I can work on personally is communication.
