Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

My thoughts on the new cell phone law is that it is pointless and won't have the effect lawmakers think it will. I'm adjusting to the law but it's annoying for me and other students. Truthfully I see little to no benefits for students or teachers alike. My first point is that the phone law is pointless, kids who dont want to learn will still choose not to participate, but instead of risking their phones they will likely just distract other students or teachers solely for their own enjoyment. I've seen this in my 2nd period, kids will just talk to other students, make noise, and still not do their work. My complaint about the law being an inconvenience rather than a decent and well planned law is from the beginning of the year. Teachers still had several activities and systems that relied on phones,especially before chromebooks were issued to students, and had to find ways to still include those activities or just skip them entirely. It also takes away time from teachers and admins having to police the halls for students with earbuds, headphones, or cell phones out, even though they're not in class yet. And lastly, I see no benefit for teachers or students. Teachers have almost always had an issue with a student's phone being out while the teacher is speaking, but now they HAVE to enforce the phone law. If a student is done with all their work, they can't have their phones out, even if a teacher is done teaching, if the teacher sees a phone, they are now required to stop what they're doing and either tell the sudent to put it away or take it from them entirely. Not to mention the law was signed in by a man that hasn't seen the inside of a school in about 50 years and has no clue what happens inside a modern school building. The law was signed in to appease a minority with money rather than a majority in mind and it's ridiculous.

One career i'm interested in is game design/developement. Computer science would be very useful in this field of work, and would allow me to be even better at it. Computer science is useful in this career because games are made almost exclusively with computers or similar technology. Coding computers would provide a pathway into coding games, and helping create them. Learning computer science before I even start would also provide a boost to my skills and necessary experience to be considered for a job in that field. Jobs in game developement earn on average 100,000$ in the U.S. Texas is a bit lower but not by much.

My idea for an AI project would be to have AI pick up brainwaves from disabled patients, relay the information to a computer and the brainwaves be translated into speach in real time. Think of the setup being somewhat like the neuralink, but instead of it being connected to your phone or car, it would be connected to a small machine with a speaker in it that would allow paralyzed, crippled or mute people to speak again. This could also easily turn into a device that allows prosthetic limbs to move on their own. Limbs like this already exist and react to muscle spasms in the body or arm, adding the ability to translate brainwave into action would just further improve the device.depending on the user the speaker could be implanted or it can be an external device as well.

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a bad idea and will harm the future of jobs. Working in a virtual store sets a bad precedent for how the future of jobs look, not only because they can be replaced easily through the use of ai but also how unsustainable it is. Stocking fake shelves, serving fake food and other actions that do not impact the real world don't matter, especially not enough to get paid for it. Working online should be reserved for technologically dependent jobs, or jobs that require working with computers like logistics, it should not and cannot be the new standard for jobs.

The joke, "67" came from an interview with LaMelo Ball. LaMelo used the numbers as a way to joke about someone's height. The joke gained popularity for being used in Skrilla's song, "Doot Doot". Skrilla's song appeared in edits featuring LaMelo Ball. The phrase became popular, and people began saying it as a joke when "67" appeared. The Joke is typically said in a light hearted manner.
